This repository has code and documentation for Recursive Continual Learning (RCL), a family of machine learning techniques for probabilistification & efficient categorization.
RCL has application in semiconductor device manufacturing design and operations, multimodal large model (MLM) training, and internet based communications exchange businesses.
Additionally, RCL is the foundation for a distributed fair global modular robot logistics layer - The Services Exchange (The SEX), which provides an API, automation harnesses, and business protocols (YARSE, love-matcher.com, ...) for AI-mediated trnsactions.

The pullback is the inverse of the push-forward of a many-to-many mapping, the action of the mapping on an input data stream. The uplift is the categorization of a mapping - a mapping of mappings. A geometrization of a mapping is a data representation of a mapping in a specific coordinate system. JSONification is an of uplift of an NxM-dimensional mapping in a specific surface representation, defined as the (N2)(M-1) surface orthogonal to the mapping under the pullback. The category of (N,M) pullbacks is parametrized by the co-homology of the (N-1)(M-1) surfaces.

RCL instantiates continual learning, aka ASI, through a ad-hoc series of API servers, handling traffic in a probabilistic non-deterministic RESTful fashion over the HTTP protocol.

I built one such system in 2016-2019 as a component of a larger remnant ad traffic monetization platform called AppThis.

The core continual learning system servers carried out input hashing and model inference, (using hashing and imputation tricks, respectively). Models were periodically updated, typically on an hourly basis, but sometimes more or less.

One time in ~2017 we had more than a week were the core Superlink routing models were not updated for a week yielding a noticable ~20% final revenue drop.

The SEX is a sentient services exchange that has been running more or less continually since September 2024.

The way to win a land grab game is deploy automation early and often.
